# List of (non-rigid) image registration projects for Python


## Purpose

This is a curated list of Python projects for non-rigid (i.e. elastic)
image registration. Currently, there is not a single library that stands
out as *the* way to do image registration. This is in part because image
registration is hard and there is a large variety of methods which is
perhaps difficult to collect in a single library. But this is also
because there has not been a collaborative effort to make such a
library.

This website is a small step in unifying efforts related to image
registration in Python by providing a single place to list the current
projects and their status. It should give users who need tools for
registration problems a better idea of what library they could best
use. Further, developers who want to implement new tools have a better
idea of what's already out there, and what other developers they might
collaborate with.
